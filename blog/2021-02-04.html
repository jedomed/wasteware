			<h1>WELCOME TO v3 :V</h1>
			<p>This is version 3 of the site, made in three days in a burst of procrastination. Now all I gotta do is actually write and illustrate the story, oh no.</p>

<p><img class="fullimg" src="/wasteware/assets/img/misc/wwv1.jpg" /></p>

<p>I rewrote pretty much all of the HTML and CSS. I didn’t have to change a lot of the JavaScript, thank god. I didn’t like how the first version functioned. The site being basically one big drawing looked neat – that was my goal when I was designing it – but it was hard to make it responsive and to add or remove anything. I half-assed some of the drawings. The “trivia” console thingy and the buttons (both are now only in ep pages) being visible everywhere sucked cause I rarely had a use for them outside of the eps. And even with everything compressed the file size was bigger than I would’ve liked. As of writing the the old version is 3.9 MB, while the current one is 1.9 MB. That’s a 49% decrease!!! wow</p>

<p><img class="fullimg" src="/wasteware/assets/img/misc/wwv2.jpg" /></p>

<p>Version 2 was a lightweight alternative that only used images where necessary (episode &amp; character pages) and didn’t use JavaScript at all. It was fun to make but it didn’t look great, and some of the Liquid code was baaad.</p>

<p>Version 3, aka this version, is kind of a combination of both. I tried to keep everything I liked the aesthetics and layout of v1, and the simplicity and responsiveness of v2. And made it so that the JS/no-JS stuff is automated, instead of being split into two different versions of the site (which was dumb). I know pretty much everyone is gonna have JS enabled, but I still think it’s good if everything works without it.</p>

<p>I also remade the little navigation icons and added some extra stuff, like this blog thing! woooooooo!!</p>
