She learned a long time ago that he doesn’t have the patience for these types of missions.</p> <p>“You can wait outside, if you wanna.”</p> <p>He walks towards her, moldy paper still in his hands. “Out of the question. You’d deteriorate and die without my company, just like this garbage bunker.”</p> <p>“At least be quiet. You’re ruining the atmosphere.”</p> <p>He laughs, ruining the atmosphere. “It’s a military base, not a haunted house.”</p> <p>Maya grabs a stapler and flings it at him. It bounces off his leg, falls on the ground, and breaks. Maybe he has a point.</p> <p>This place has been raided before, there’s nothing left that someone else hasn’t already taken or broken. She really is digging through trash.</p> <p>///</p> <p>“Did you check that door yet?” Lex points at one of the dirty wall tiles. Less damaged than the rest, possibly from a different material. It’s jutting out of the wall in a barely noticeable manner.</p> <p>She bangs on it, and an echo confirms that there’s space behind it. “How did you notice that?”</p> <p>“There’s gasoline inside, I can smell it.”</p> <p>“And you couldn’t have mentioned that earlier?”</p> <p>“Um, I thought you already knew.”</p> <p>///</p> <p>The only thing that looks like it could open it is a keypad on the opposite side of the room. It looks as if the last person who came here got frustrated and smashed it with a crowbar. If it doesn’t work, they can always come back with better tools and pry the panel open.</p> <p>“Look for circuit breakers. We’re gonna need power for this.”</p> <p>“Wilco. Can you hold this?” He hands Maya the brochures despite her visible disgust, and disappears into the shadows. The front page shows a faded photo of a rhino soldier, alongside the standard monochrome blue flag are paragraphs inviting the reader to join the Nychinian forces.</p> <p>She stuffs it into her backpack and pulls out a screwdriver. The keypad’s already damaged, and the cover comes off easily. She squats in front of the panel and gets to work. The bunker was an obvious rush job, electronics included. Still, it takes her a while to figure out how to hijack it.</p> <p>///</p> <p>Sparks fly out of the panel – she yelps and jumps back. The ceiling lights up and rapid footsteps follow.</p> <p>“Did it work?” Lex yells from the corridor.</p> <p>“I don’t know,” Maya rubs her eyes, “warn me next time.” She points at the panel.</p> <p>“Oh. Sorry.”</p> <p>She reconnects the last few wires while Lex watches. The screen’s backlight activates, and a deep sound reverberates the room. The hidden door creaks, but it’s mechanisms struggle after such a long period of disuse.</p> <p>///</p> <p>From the cracks between the panels, translucent liquid drips down the wall and fills the room with a bittersweet smell. Another sizzling sound draws their attention to the ceiling, where more sparks fly from damaged cables. They vanish before they can hit the floor.</p> <p>“Should I turn the power off?”</p> <p>Maya nods, and Lex rushes back into the corridor. She picks up her flashlight before everything goes dark and silent again, and pushes the panel the rest of the way open.</p> <p>She covers her face to block the fumes and crawls inside. The tunnel is at a downwards angle, with indents to help climbing back up. Both of them use it as a slide.</p> <p>The room looks mostly intact. And significantly fancier than the rest of the bunker. The armored walls still look brand new, and all the furniture is metal. There’s even a dedicated bathroom.</p> <p>///</p> <p>“At least we know where the budget went,” Lex says. “Nobody’s been here before us?”</p> <p>She stares at him.</p> <p>“After the evacuation, I mean.”</p> <p>“Unlikely.” Gasoline splashes under them as they walk. The liquid’s coming from two fuel drums, one ruptured and the other knocked over. Lex grins. “Touch that and I’ll evict you.”</p> <p>“You don’t legally own the house.” He removes the undamaged barrel’s lid and shoves his face inside. His shirt and hair are wet, but he doesn’t mind.</p> <p>///</p> <p>Maya climbs on top of a table to get a better look at their surroundings. “Don’t come near me. You’re gross and a fire hazard.”</p> <p>Lex pauses. “Why is it even here? Flammable poison isn’t allowed to be in an office, let alone an emergency chamber.”</p> <p>“It must be recent, otherwise it would have evaporated.” Maya points her flashlight at a rusty door.</p> <p>“Can we set it on fire?”</p> <p>“Nope.” The table almost tips over as she lands. She digs her heels into the ground and forces the door open. It creaks and leaves a dirty line across the tiling.</p> <p>///</p> <!--BG=computer.jpg--> <p>The next room is even smaller. It appears to be a repurposed supply closet with a computer in the corner. She unplugs it, removes the case, and connects it to an external battery in her backpack.</p> <p>It boots, albeit slowly. She sits in the somewhat clean office chair and smashes the <em>Del</em> key repeatedly. Lex kneels next to her and rests his arms on the table.</p> <p>“Look for a ground plan. Maybe there’s more hidden rooms.”</p> <p>“I doubt it.” The computer is whirring loudly. They could have cleaned it first. “Can you check the fans?”</p> <p>“While it’s running?!”</p> <p>“You almost got me electrocuted, now it’s your turn.” The desktop loads and a number of programs automatically open.</p> <p>A mail client, a network manager failing to connect anything in the ravaged bunker, and on top of it all, a notification from the command center.</p> <p>It’s written in a formal emotionless manner, but the message it sends is clear. <em>Our mission is more important than yours, so get out of our way</em>, as Lex explained it. There’s bound to be thousands of warnings like this logged somewhere, but something about it seems off.</p> <p>///</p> <p>“Quit staring at it like that. Some rhinos raided some camp decades ago, there’s nothing you can do about it now.”</p> <p><em>Decades ago?</em> “Lex. Look at the date.”</p> <p>He stands up. “This is from last month… wait, that’s stupid. No rhino has been here since they canceled the invasion!”</p> <p>“Not canceled, only suspended.”</p> <p>“Are they coming back?!”</p> <p>“That’s what I’d like to know.”</p> <p>///</p> <p>Lex tenses up. He shoves Maya aside and grabs the mouse. The logs go ninety years back, about two centuries using the local calendar. A huge gap, and then they start again.</p> <p>“Here!” he points at the screen. “Two months ago the bunker’s communications were <em>remotely reactivated by an unmanned ship</em>. You know what that means?”</p> <p>The whole continent has defenses designed to interfere with foreign aircraft, though it’s hard to tell how effective they actually are. “They got past the shields.”</p> <p>“They got past the shields! The one thing keeping this place safe and rhino-free and they fucking got past it!”</p> <p>“Calm down. We’ll report it to the border guards, they’ll deal with it.”</p> <p>“What could they even <em>want</em>, there’s nothing on this stupid island!”</p> <p>“Hey!”</p> <p>///</p> <p>“What!?” He lurches up. Most of what was on the table falls to the ground. “It’s true! Your natural resources are exhausted, the population is scattered and disorganized, and the biggest city is an actual landfill! There’s nothing to gain here but real estate and viral diseases!”</p> <p>He’s towering over her, stiff and unbreathing. “Are you done?”</p> <p>“If they find out we were digging through their shit… they can track us, they’ll catch me and fly me back to Nychinus, and if they catch <em>you</em>–”</p> <p>“Dude. They’re not gonna catch us.” She grabs his arm in an attempt at a comforting gesture. “What are they planning?”</p> <p>“I don’t know! They could be sending anything from crop dusters to dive bombers, these warnings are always vague as shit.” He opens a program that shows four different locations. “That one’s the aerodrome, the rest must be targets. They use different IDs.”</p> <p>The map shows that the first two targets- <em>towns</em> were already invaded. The third doesn’t have a date, but the mission should be over in a few days. Maya enters the coordinates in her PDA. “There’s still time. Come on.”</p> <p>///</p> <!--LED=lex--> <!--TRIVIA=Fernery | EAST KOLIG, RTL--> <!--BG=garden.jpg--> <p>Their first stop is a town more resembling a botanic garden than a residential area.</p> <p>The glasshouses are spread out, with farms and overflowing flora in-between. Even the few exotic plants appear to be thriving in the local weather. More importantly, it happens to be the closest town with no border and a functional council.</p> <p>///</p> <p>“Not to piss on your parade, but they weren’t too happy to see us the last twenty times we came here.”</p> <p>“Hush. We’ll just tell them what we found, they’ll know what to do.”</p> <p>“<em>Next.</em>”</p> <p>Maya rushes to the front desk before someone else can take their place, and Lex reluctantly follows. The receptionist greets them with a forced smile. “How can I help you?”</p> <p>“Good morning. We have new intel regarding Nychinus.”</p> <p>They look halfway between disinterested and amused. “Is there someone or something you’d like to report?”</p> <p>They’re looking directly at Lex as they say it. Maya either doesn’t notice or doesn’t react.</p> <p>“Rhinos managed to bypass the shields, we need to inform the border guards. A town about 30 kilometers away from here is about to be attacked.”</p> <p>“Of course.”</p> <p>“Listen,” Lex jumps in, “we have all the files here. If you care about your people’s safety you <em>have</em> to take us–”</p> <p>///</p> <p>The emergency sirens go off.</p> <p>“…seriously.”</p> <p>People brush past them as they run outside. Some are at their balconies, still in pajamas. Everyone is looking up, where distinctly foreign ships drift across the sky.</p> <p>///</p> <!--BG=invasion.jpg--> <p>They fly low above the ground, and the noise and trails immediately tell him that they’re older models.</p> <p>As soon as they disappear behind trees and greenhouses, the townsfolk start murmuring and panicking. Their attention turns to Lex and Maya.</p> <p>The receptionist stands by uselessly as a bunch of smartasses discuss how he must be connected to this – those were Nychinian ships and <em>he’s the only Nychinian person in here so of course–</em></p> <p>Maya grabs his hand. “Uh, let’s go.”</p> <p>///</p> <p>She pulls him in the direction where they parked. The overgrown sidewalks make it hard to not crash into people, but as he looks back nobody tries to stop them.</p> <p>They find their car untouched at the edge of the town, hidden behind a clump of bushes. Maya gets inside and opens a map on her PDA. “Which direction did the jet go?”</p> <p>“East. And the last target is…”</p> <p>“West. They’re returning to the aerodrome,” she sinks in her seat. “We’re late. If we drove to the town right away then–”</p> <p>“Then what? We’d single-handedly defeat the whole squad and save the day?” He doesn’t know how many rhinos there were, if they were soldiers or if they even caused any damage, but he can make an educated guess. “Even if we knew months in advance, nobody would’ve believed us.”</p> <p>She starts the car without a reply, so he gets in his seat and shuts up.</p> <p>///</p> <!--BG=outside.jpg--> <!--TRIVIA=Target town C | EAST KOLIG, RTL--> <p>“We’re here,” Maya nudges him.</p> <p>A pair of stars light up the valley. In the middle of it is a massive cloud, reminiscent of the chemical attacks he’s seen in training videos. It’s dense and colorless, contrasting with the warm red landscape. “Why’d you park here? It’s gonna take like five extra minutes to walk there.”</p> <p>“We don’t know how dangerous it is.”</p> <p>The cloud’s surroundings <em>do</em> look pretty lifeless. “Hmm. You should stay here.”</p> <p>“Yeah.”</p> <p>“Wait, really?” Maya is still in the car, eyes shut and pressing her palm against her face. “Okay, what am I supposed to look for? Weapons, bodies?”</p> <p>“Anything out of the ordinary. I’ll park somewhere else.” She turns the car around and drives off.</p> <p>///</p> <p>“Huh. It must be pretty bad if she’s backing away that quickly.” The cloud looks like it’s shifting – clinging to the ground and spreading around it.</p> <p>His boots are wet from the morning dew, and every few feet a grasshopper jumps away from where he steps. It happens less frequently the closer he gets to the cloud.</p> <p>///</p> <!--BG=cloud.jpg--> <p>He steps one foot inside. The gas spreads around his leg, like liquid would in low gravity. The grass underneath darkens and shrinks.</p> <p>A few more steps and it reaches his face. It smells repulsive, and he quickly remembers that he doesn’t need to breathe all the time. It gets harder and harder to see. The only indication that he’s moving at all is the sound of his footsteps.</p> <p>He closes his eyes, assuming that they won’t be of any use, and walks into a wall.</p> <p>///</p> <p>The structure is cobbled together from rocks and soil. He circles it, with one hand always touching the wall, until he finds an entrance.</p> <p>There’s a locked door – more accurately, a plank of wood jammed between two more rocks. He kicks it a few times and it falls apart.</p> <p>He knows this shouldn’t irritate him – these people aren’t making their houses crappy and structurally unsound on purpose, resources and workers are scarce – but it still disappoints him.</p> <p>///</p> <p>Inside the house is most likely an assortment of items and furniture that he can’t see. He manages to identify a hay bed and a couple of wooden shelves before leaving.</p> <p>There’s no reason for a camp this big to be this deserted. He should have been assaulted by the sound of twenty barking dogs the second he entered their range of smell.</p> <p>He really doesn’t want to be here, but he has an objective. If Maya is convinced they can go against rhinos then he has to at least try.</p> <p>///</p> <p>Navigating by touch, he finds more houses and gardens. Once he bumps into a pile of plant remains topped by a feline carcass, he realizes that he doesn’t actually know what <em>out of the ordinary</em> means.</p> <p>He climbs over the garden’s fence and falls face-first into tall grass. Amongst the dirt and weed are bright yellow flowers, seemingly unaffected by the gas. They lead to a muddy path covered in footprints. This has to be the way out.</p> <p>Sunlight shines through the fog, and he speeds up. His boot catches on something large, but he acts fast and lands with only his hands sunken in mud.</p> <p>Ugh, his clothes are gonna be filthy.</p> <p>///</p> <p>The obstruction is warm, soft, and… breathing?</p> <p>He’s relieved once he confirms that it’s a person and not an animal carcass. He tries to pick them up by their torso, but gives up and ends up dragging them by their legs along the path.</p> <p>More light shines through. His vision becomes clearer, and he finds himself in a weedy field. One side is encircled by trees, the rest is blocked off by the cloud.</p> <p>With his luck, he probably came out at the furthest point from where he started. He walks as far away from the cloud as he can, and sits down next to the body.</p> <p>///</p> <!--BG=kvido.jpg--> <p>They’re even smaller than Maya, dressed head to toe in clothes that look like they’ve been ripped and repaired more than once. Their face is hidden behind thick hair, and they’re covered in mud.</p> <p>“Hey?” Lex pokes them gently, but they’re knocked out hard. “HEY! WAKE UP!”</p> <p>They slowly open their eyes. Their sclerae are nearly black, and their irises are thin and… pupil-less? That’s new.</p> <p>Messed up eyes, big claws, hairless skin – they must be an elytron like Maya.</p> <p>///</p> <p>“Don’t you dare faint! I can’t carry your ass around everywhere.”</p> <p>They get up and step back shakily, squinting at Lex. “Uh, who are you?”</p> <p>“Your personal rescue team. I have nothing to do with the poison cloud, by the way.”</p> <p>“Poison?” They clear their throat, but their voice stays scratchy. “Where’s everyone else?”</p> <p>“Uh, who?”</p> <p>///</p> <p>“My neighbors. The rest of the town.”</p> <p>Oh, they call their camp a town. “If I knew that, you wouldn’t be talking to me right now.”</p> <p>They’re looking down and fiddling with the hem of their sleeve.</p> <p>“You’re a local, right? Can you help me find my coworker? She’s… over there,” he gestures at the cloud.</p> <p>“You want to walk around it?” they ask, in a tone more mocking than they probably intended. “Are you asking for shortcuts, or…?”</p> <p>“Sure, lead the way.” <em>This is a time-sensitive issue</em>, he almost adds. If the attack happened only a few hours ago, the culprits might still be around.</p> <p>///</p> <p>But what can they even do about it? The cloud proves that this was a military operation, going after them would be suicidal.</p> <p>“Hey?” The rescuee stands above on a forest slope, waiting for Lex to catch up. “What do you know about the, uh, gas hemisphere?”</p> <p>“It’s the result of an aerial attack orchestrated by the Nychinian army for currently unknown reasons,” Lex recites.</p> <p>“Uh, okay.”</p> <p>///</p> <!--BG=forest.jpg--> <p>“You know, there’s rumors about elytra being a result of rhino bio-engineering bullshit, like what they did with the fauna on their planet. It would explain why they targeted your camp specifically.” He looks over at them, “your neighbors were elytra too, right?”</p> <p>They nod.</p> <p>“So I thought. Rhinos ruin everything they touch.”</p> <p>And start walking faster.</p> <p>“Wait, that came out bad.”</p> <p>They point at a car parked in the distance. “Is that your coworker?”</p> <p>///</p> <p>“Yeah.” Maya moved to the top of the valley, probably to stay away from the heavy gas. Or to piss off Lex by making him walk up there on foot. “Don’t worry, once we get there it’ll be all driving.”</p> <p>“I don’t mind walking,” they murmur.</p> <p>Lex doesn’t respond. This was already awkward and he’s making it worse with every new sentence.</p> <p>///</p> <!--BG=outside.jpg--> <p>They reach the top without another word. Maya is splayed over both front seats, scribbling notes on maps and papers. She looks up when she finally notices them.</p> <p>“Report.”</p> <p>“We have to come back when the gas disperses, or bring a two kilowatt flashlight with us. I couldn’t see shit.” He gestures behind him, “also, I found a body.”</p> <p>///</p> <p>Maya gets up and stares at the rescuue for a solid five seconds.</p> <p>“Hello, I’m Maya Gordan,” she offers a stiff hand. It’s too formal, and an obvious excuse to show them that she has claws too.</p> <p>“Kvido,” they glance at Lex. He realizes he didn’t introduce himself. Great, now Maya will think that he didn’t bother asking for their name.</p> <p>“And I’m Lex, <em>as you already know</em>.”</p> <p>Kvido squints. “My one-man rescue team, yeah.”</p> <p>///</p> <p>Maya is side-eyeing him, screw this little shit for playing along. “I forgot, okay? Fucking hell.”</p> <p>“Lex!” she shouts, “watch your language around kids!”</p> <p>“That’s a kid?!”</p> <p>“Obviously,” she turns to Kvido, “how old are you?”</p> <p>“Fourteen trienniums. Or, um, 52 years.”</p> <p>///</p> <p>“It’s trienni<em>a</em>,” he corrects. “How is that more practical than using years?”</p> <p>“I have a system,” they whisper and look at Maya, “can I ask, where are you gonna go now?”</p> <p>“Back to our home base. You don’t have anywhere to stay?”</p> <p>“I have this deer stand,” they hesitate, “it’s not really <em>mine</em>, but nobody’s using it. I slept there last night, and when I went back there was all that gas…”</p> <p>“And you decided to <em>walk into it</em>?!”</p> <p>Kvido flinches. “I didn’t realize I was that close! It knocked me out before I noticed that it was affecting me.”</p> <p>///</p> <p>“Sounds like anything you worked with?” Maya asks.</p> <p>“Chemistry wasn’t my field, but if it didn’t kill you then it’s safe to assume it wasn’t designed to kill you.”</p> <p>Kvido bounces nervously. “So, it was made to knock us out. Does that mean everyone was kidnapped?”</p> <p>“Most likely.” Maya gets back in the car and pats the seat next to her. “Come on, let’s get you out of here.”</p> <p>///</p> <p>Kvido stands still for a moment before finally sitting down. They watch Lex as he walks to the trunk and sprawls himself across it’s floor. It looks like they wanna say something, but give up.</p> <p>Nobody seems to be interested in starting a conversation, so Lex closes his eyes and drifts off to the engine’s rumbling.</p> </div> <div id="nojscontent" class="nojs"> <h1>INVASION</h1> <img class="epimg" src="/wasteware/assets/img/episodes/1/01/title.jpg"> <p>Two nerds raid an abandoned military bunker.</p> <ul> <li><b>Word count:</b> 3.4k</li> <li><b>Page count:</b> 35</li> <li><b>Uploaded:</b> 2020-09-12</li><li><b>Last edited:</b> 2021-01-13</li></ul><!--LED=maya--> <!--TRIVIA=MZ14-3 Bunker | EAST KOLIG, RTL--> <img class='epimg' src='/wasteware/assets/img/episodes/1/01/bunker.jpg'> <p>In a chamber deep underground, with decomposing furniture, crumbled walls, and air so cold it’s painful to inhale, a pair of explorers stand ten feet away from each other.</p> <p>“You don’t have to inspect every piece of trash like it’s a crime scene.” With nothing better to do, Maya’s assistant has resorted to reading old brochures.

She sits in the somewhat clean office chair and smashes the <em>Del</em> key repeatedly. Lex kneels next to her and rests his arms on the table.</p> <p>“Look for a ground plan. Maybe there’s more hidden rooms.”</p> <p>“I doubt it.” The computer is whirring loudly. They could have cleaned it first. “Can you check the fans?”</p> <p>“While it’s running?!”</p> <p>“You almost got me electrocuted, now it’s your turn.” The desktop loads and a number of programs automatically open.</p> <p>A mail client, a network manager failing to connect anything in the ravaged bunker, and on top of it all, a notification from the command center.</p> <p>It’s written in a formal emotionless manner, but the message it sends is clear. <em>Our mission is more important than yours, so get out of our way</em>, as Lex explained it. There’s bound to be thousands of warnings like this logged somewhere, but something about it seems off.</p> <p></p> <p>“Quit staring at it like that. Some rhinos raided some camp decades ago, there’s nothing you can do about it now.”</p> <p><em>Decades ago?</em> “Lex. Look at the date.”</p> <p>He stands up. “This is from last month… wait, that’s stupid. No rhino has been here since they canceled the invasion!”</p> <p>“Not canceled, only suspended.”</p> <p>“Are they coming back?!”</p> <p>“That’s what I’d like to know.”</p> <p></p> <p>Lex tenses up. He shoves Maya aside and grabs the mouse. The logs go ninety years back, about two centuries using the local calendar. A huge gap, and then they start again.</p> <p>“Here!” he points at the screen. “Two months ago the bunker’s communications were <em>remotely reactivated by an unmanned ship</em>. You know what that means?”</p> <p>The whole continent has defenses designed to interfere with foreign aircraft, though it’s hard to tell how effective they actually are. “They got past the shields.”</p> <p>“They got past the shields! The one thing keeping this place safe and rhino-free and they fucking got past it!”</p> <p>“Calm down. We’ll report it to the border guards, they’ll deal with it.”</p> <p>“What could they even <em>want</em>, there’s nothing on this stupid island!”</p> <p>“Hey!”</p> <p></p> <p>“What!?” He lurches up. Most of what was on the table falls to the ground. “It’s true! Your natural resources are exhausted, the population is scattered and disorganized, and the biggest city is an actual landfill! There’s nothing to gain here but real estate and viral diseases!”</p> <p>He’s towering over her, stiff and unbreathing. “Are you done?”</p> <p>“If they find out we were digging through their shit… they can track us, they’ll catch me and fly me back to Nychinus, and if they catch <em>you</em>–”</p> <p>“Dude. They’re not gonna catch us.” She grabs his arm in an attempt at a comforting gesture. “What are they planning?”</p> <p>“I don’t know! They could be sending anything from crop dusters to dive bombers, these warnings are always vague as shit.” He opens a program that shows four different locations. “That one’s the aerodrome, the rest must be targets. They use different IDs.”</p> <p>The map shows that the first two targets- <em>towns</em> were already invaded. The third doesn’t have a date, but the mission should be over in a few days. Maya enters the coordinates in her PDA. “There’s still time. Come on.”</p> <p></p> <!--LED=lex--> <!--TRIVIA=Fernery | EAST KOLIG, RTL--> <img class='epimg' src='/wasteware/assets/img/episodes/1/01/garden.jpg'> <p>Their first stop is a town more resembling a botanic garden than a residential area.</p> <p>The glasshouses are spread out, with farms and overflowing flora in-between. Even the few exotic plants appear to be thriving in the local weather. More importantly, it happens to be the closest town with no border and a functional council.</p> <p></p> <p>“Not to piss on your parade, but they weren’t too happy to see us the last twenty times we came here.”</p> <p>“Hush. We’ll just tell them what we found, they’ll know what to do.”</p> <p>“<em>Next.</em>”</p> <p>Maya rushes to the front desk before someone else can take their place, and Lex reluctantly follows. The receptionist greets them with a forced smile. “How can I help you?”</p> <p>“Good morning. We have new intel regarding Nychinus.”</p> <p>They look halfway between disinterested and amused. “Is there someone or something you’d like to report?”</p> <p>They’re looking directly at Lex as they say it. Maya either doesn’t notice or doesn’t react.</p> <p>“Rhinos managed to bypass the shields, we need to inform the border guards. A town about 30 kilometers away from here is about to be attacked.”</p> <p>“Of course.”</p> <p>“Listen,” Lex jumps in, “we have all the files here. If you care about your people’s safety you <em>have</em> to take us–”</p> <p></p> <p>The emergency sirens go off.</p> <p>“…seriously.”</p> <p>People brush past them as they run outside. Some are at their balconies, still in pajamas. Everyone is looking up, where distinctly foreign ships drift across the sky.</p> <p></p> <img class='epimg' src='/wasteware/assets/img/episodes/1/01/invasion.jpg'> <p>They fly low above the ground, and the noise and trails immediately tell him that they’re older models.</p> <p>As soon as they disappear behind trees and greenhouses, the townsfolk start murmuring and panicking. Their attention turns to Lex and Maya.</p> <p>The receptionist stands by uselessly as a bunch of smartasses discuss how he must be connected to this – those were Nychinian ships and <em>he’s the only Nychinian person in here so of course–</em></p> <p>Maya grabs his hand. “Uh, let’s go.”</p> <p></p> <p>She pulls him in the direction where they parked. The overgrown sidewalks make it hard to not crash into people, but as he looks back nobody tries to stop them.</p> <p>They find their car untouched at the edge of the town, hidden behind a clump of bushes. Maya gets inside and opens a map on her PDA. “Which direction did the jet go?”</p> <p>“East. And the last target is…”</p> <p>“West. They’re returning to the aerodrome,” she sinks in her seat. “We’re late. If we drove to the town right away then–”</p> <p>“Then what? We’d single-handedly defeat the whole squad and save the day?” He doesn’t know how many rhinos there were, if they were soldiers or if they even caused any damage, but he can make an educated guess. “Even if we knew months in advance, nobody would’ve believed us.”</p> <p>She starts the car without a reply, so he gets in his seat and shuts up.</p> <p></p> <img class='epimg' src='/wasteware/assets/img/episodes/1/01/outside.jpg'> <!--TRIVIA=Target town C | EAST KOLIG, RTL--> <p>“We’re here,” Maya nudges him.</p> <p>A pair of stars light up the valley. In the middle of it is a massive cloud, reminiscent of the chemical attacks he’s seen in training videos. It’s dense and colorless, contrasting with the warm red landscape. “Why’d you park here? It’s gonna take like five extra minutes to walk there.”</p> <p>“We don’t know how dangerous it is.”</p> <p>The cloud’s surroundings <em>do</em> look pretty lifeless. “Hmm. You should stay here.”</p> <p>“Yeah.”</p> <p>“Wait, really?” Maya is still in the car, eyes shut and pressing her palm against her face. “Okay, what am I supposed to look for? Weapons, bodies?”</p> <p>“Anything out of the ordinary. I’ll park somewhere else.” She turns the car around and drives off.</p> <p></p> <p>“Huh. It must be pretty bad if she’s backing away that quickly.” The cloud looks like it’s shifting – clinging to the ground and spreading around it.</p> <p>His boots are wet from the morning dew, and every few feet a grasshopper jumps away from where he steps. It happens less frequently the closer he gets to the cloud.</p> <p></p> <img class='epimg' src='/wasteware/assets/img/episodes/1/01/cloud.jpg'> <p>He steps one foot inside. The gas spreads around his leg, like liquid would in low gravity. The grass underneath darkens and shrinks.</p> <p>A few more steps and it reaches his face. It smells repulsive, and he quickly remembers that he doesn’t need to breathe all the time. It gets harder and harder to see. The only indication that he’s moving at all is the sound of his footsteps.</p> <p>He closes his eyes, assuming that they won’t be of any use, and walks into a wall.</p> <p></p> <p>The structure is cobbled together from rocks and soil. He circles it, with one hand always touching the wall, until he finds an entrance.</p> <p>There’s a locked door – more accurately, a plank of wood jammed between two more rocks. He kicks it a few times and it falls apart.</p> <p>He knows this shouldn’t irritate him – these people aren’t making their houses crappy and structurally unsound on purpose, resources and workers are scarce – but it still disappoints him.</p> <p></p> <p>Inside the house is most likely an assortment of items and furniture that he can’t see. He manages to identify a hay bed and a couple of wooden shelves before leaving.</p> <p>There’s no reason for a camp this big to be this deserted. He should have been assaulted by the sound of twenty barking dogs the second he entered their range of smell.</p> <p>He really doesn’t want to be here, but he has an objective. If Maya is convinced they can go against rhinos then he has to at least try.</p> <p></p> <p>Navigating by touch, he finds more houses and gardens. Once he bumps into a pile of plant remains topped by a feline carcass, he realizes that he doesn’t actually know what <em>out of the ordinary</em> means.</p> <p>He climbs over the garden’s fence and falls face-first into tall grass. Amongst the dirt and weed are bright yellow flowers, seemingly unaffected by the gas. They lead to a muddy path covered in footprints. This has to be the way out.</p> <p>Sunlight shines through the fog, and he speeds up. His boot catches on something large, but he acts fast and lands with only his hands sunken in mud.</p> <p>Ugh, his clothes are gonna be filthy.</p> <p></p> <p>The obstruction is warm, soft, and… breathing?</p> <p>He’s relieved once he confirms that it’s a person and not an animal carcass. He tries to pick them up by their torso, but gives up and ends up dragging them by their legs along the path.</p> <p>More light shines through. His vision becomes clearer, and he finds himself in a weedy field. One side is encircled by trees, the rest is blocked off by the cloud.</p> <p>With his luck, he probably came out at the furthest point from where he started. He walks as far away from the cloud as he can, and sits down next to the body.</p> <p></p> <img class='epimg' src='/wasteware/assets/img/episodes/1/01/kvido.jpg'> <p>They’re even smaller than Maya, dressed head to toe in clothes that look like they’ve been ripped and repaired more than once. Their face is hidden behind thick hair, and they’re covered in mud.</p> <p>“Hey?” Lex pokes them gently, but they’re knocked out hard. “HEY! WAKE UP!”</p> <p>They slowly open their eyes. Their sclerae are nearly black, and their irises are thin and… pupil-less? That’s new.</p> <p>Messed up eyes, big claws, hairless skin – they must be an elytron like Maya.</p> <p></p> <p>“Don’t you dare faint! I can’t carry your ass around everywhere.”</p> <p>They get up and step back shakily, squinting at Lex. “Uh, who are you?”</p> <p>“Your personal rescue team. I have nothing to do with the poison cloud, by the way.”</p> <p>“Poison?” They clear their throat, but their voice stays scratchy. “Where’s everyone else?”</p> <p>“Uh, who?”</p> <p></p> <p>“My neighbors. The rest of the town.”</p> <p>Oh, they call their camp a town. “If I knew that, you wouldn’t be talking to me right now.”</p> <p>They’re looking down and fiddling with the hem of their sleeve.</p> <p>“You’re a local, right? Can you help me find my coworker? She’s… over there,” he gestures at the cloud.</p> <p>“You want to walk around it?” they ask, in a tone more mocking than they probably intended. “Are you asking for shortcuts, or…?”</p> <p>“Sure, lead the way.” <em>This is a time-sensitive issue</em>, he almost adds. If the attack happened only a few hours ago, the culprits might still be around.</p> <p></p> <p>But what can they even do about it? The cloud proves that this was a military operation, going after them would be suicidal.</p> <p>“Hey?” The rescuee stands above on a forest slope, waiting for Lex to catch up. “What do you know about the, uh, gas hemisphere?”</p> <p>“It’s the result of an aerial attack orchestrated by the Nychinian army for currently unknown reasons,” Lex recites.</p> <p>“Uh, okay.”</p> <p></p> <img class='epimg' src='/wasteware/assets/img/episodes/1/01/forest.jpg'> <p>“You know, there’s rumors about elytra being a result of rhino bio-engineering bullshit, like what they did with the fauna on their planet. It would explain why they targeted your camp specifically.” He looks over at them, “your neighbors were elytra too, right?”</p> <p>They nod.</p> <p>“So I thought. Rhinos ruin everything they touch.”</p> <p>And start walking faster.</p> <p>“Wait, that came out bad.”</p> <p>They point at a car parked in the distance. “Is that your coworker?”</p> <p></p> <p>“Yeah.” Maya moved to the top of the valley, probably to stay away from the heavy gas. Or to piss off Lex by making him walk up there on foot. “Don’t worry, once we get there it’ll be all driving.”</p> <p>“I don’t mind walking,” they murmur.</p> <p>Lex doesn’t respond. This was already awkward and he’s making it worse with every new sentence.</p> <p></p> <img class='epimg' src='/wasteware/assets/img/episodes/1/01/outside.jpg'> <p>They reach the top without another word. Maya is splayed over both front seats, scribbling notes on maps and papers. She looks up when she finally notices them.</p> <p>“Report.”</p> <p>“We have to come back when the gas disperses, or bring a two kilowatt flashlight with us. I couldn’t see shit.” He gestures behind him, “also, I found a body.”</p> <p></p> <p>Maya gets up and stares at the rescuue for a solid five seconds.</p> <p>“Hello, I’m Maya Gordan,” she offers a stiff hand. It’s too formal, and an obvious excuse to show them that she has claws too.</p> <p>“Kvido,” they glance at Lex. He realizes he didn’t introduce himself. Great, now Maya will think that he didn’t bother asking for their name.</p> <p>“And I’m Lex, <em>as you already know</em>.”</p> <p>Kvido squints. “My one-man rescue team, yeah.”</p> <p></p> <p>Maya is side-eyeing him, screw this little shit for playing along. “I forgot, okay? Fucking hell.”</p> <p>“Lex!” she shouts, “watch your language around kids!”</p> <p>“That’s a kid?!”</p> <p>“Obviously,” she turns to Kvido, “how old are you?”</p> <p>“Fourteen trienniums. Or, um, 52 years.”</p> <p></p> <p>“It’s trienni<em>a</em>,” he corrects. “How is that more practical than using years?”</p> <p>“I have a system,” they whisper and look at Maya, “can I ask, where are you gonna go now?”</p> <p>“Back to our home base. You don’t have anywhere to stay?”</p> <p>“I have this deer stand,” they hesitate, “it’s not really <em>mine</em>, but nobody’s using it. I slept there last night, and when I went back there was all that gas…”</p> <p>“And you decided to <em>walk into it</em>?!”</p> <p>Kvido flinches. “I didn’t realize I was that close! It knocked me out before I noticed that it was affecting me.”</p> <p></p> <p>“Sounds like anything you worked with?” Maya asks.</p> <p>“Chemistry wasn’t my field, but if it didn’t kill you then it’s safe to assume it wasn’t designed to kill you.”</p> <p>Kvido bounces nervously. “So, it was made to knock us out. Does that mean everyone was kidnapped?”</p> <p>“Most likely.” Maya gets back in the car and pats the seat next to her. “Come on, let’s get you out of here.”</p> <p></p> <p>Kvido stands still for a moment before finally sitting down. They watch Lex as he walks to the trunk and sprawls himself across it’s floor. It looks like they wanna say something, but give up.</p> <p>Nobody seems to be interested in starting a conversation, so Lex closes his eyes and drifts off to the engine’s rumbling.</p> </div> <div id="epcontrol" class="nojs"> <input type="number" min="0" max="999" id="page"><a id="b_jumpto">></a> <div><!-- filler :( --></div> <a id="b_prevep" ><<</a> <a id="b_prev"><</a> <a id="b_next">></a> <a id="b_nextep" >>></a> </div> </article><div id="sidebar" class="nojs"> <div class="tooltip nojs" id="b_eps">EPS</div> <div class="tooltip nojs" id="b_chars">CHARS</div> <div id="eplist" class="nojs"> <a id="epindex" href="/wasteware/episodes"><b>INDEX</b></a> <hr><a href="/wasteware/episodes/1/01"><div class="epentry">> <span class="eptitle">01.
